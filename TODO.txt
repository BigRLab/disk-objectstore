# Less urgent
- Risk of corruption of SQLite DB

- Check cost of the validation function

- implement function to do a full repack, recreating each pack only with the known objects (e.g. if something was deleted)

- validation of pack (e.g. for overlapping bits)

- options to pack only a subset of the loose objects (e.g. specified with regex, explicit list, or just prefix).

- add tests for locking (and for much more)

PERFORMANCE: try to get and recreate the repository for 
- My own DB
- SSSP
- 3DD

PERFORMANCE: measure overhead of the SQLite DBs (and maybe check if the cost if,
for typical DBs, recovered by compressing)
